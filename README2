	SrSv nee SurrealServices is currently being developed
with UnrealIRCd 3.2.x in mind. As such many assumptions may be
in place even if we did not intend there to be. This will
probably make porting difficult, if not impossible. We, the
coders, would like to apologize in advance for this fact.

	This is an unfortunate consequence of only having
UnrealIRCd at our immediate disposal. We would welcome patches
to clean up such difficulties, as long as they remain
sufficiently clean/readable and do not introduce assumptions
incompatible with other ircds that SrSv is attempting to work
with.

	Among the assumptions to be noted are that all of your
ircds are properly configured and that the configurations are
uniform throughout your irc-network. We believe that this is a
necessary aspect of a properly maintained network, and as such
should not be an undue burden.

	Further of note is that SrSv does not have a full
capability list for ircds and such may be necessary for
portability (if your ircd does not support things like WATCH,
SILENCE, etc).

	IRC Networks known to be using SrSv as of this date
(20060904):
	irc.talkingirc.net
	irc.surrealchat.net (duh)
	irc.webchatting.com

	We would appreciate any success reports from other networks,
contact us on irc.surrealchat.net #dev.lounge or via email:
tabris@surrealchat.net or saturn@surrealchat.net
