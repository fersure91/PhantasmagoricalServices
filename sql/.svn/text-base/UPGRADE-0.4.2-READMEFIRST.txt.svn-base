0.4.2 is the first time in a long time that we are changing the database
format that requires a script to run.

This version has both an updatedb-0.4.2.sql file, and an
upgrade-0.4.2.pl script. The order you run this in does not matter.

fwiw, for now, the upgrade script is optional, but recommended for
security reasons. For now, 0.4.2 will remain compatible with the
non-hashed passwords, but this may be removed at a later date.

This is a major change in how passwords will work. SENDPASS is being
changed. If the password is hashed, it will not send the actual password
but an authentication code that will allow the user to identify and
change their password. Additionally, GETPASS has been removed, as it
will no longer work.

Please notify your staff. Notify your users too.
