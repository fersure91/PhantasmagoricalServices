%BBotServ SET%B sets flags on bots.

  PRIVATE   - defaults to on. Set it off to make a bot public.
  DEAF      - Sets a bot to have umode +d, thus will not receive
              channel messages. Mostly useful to reduce load.
              Deaf bots will not be able to be used for
              any kind of badword kicking.
