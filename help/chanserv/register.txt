%BChanServ REGISTER%B registers a channel in the ChanServ
database.  In order to use this command, you must first be a
channel operator on the channel you're trying to register.
 
Syntax: %BREGISTER%B %U#channel%U [%Upassword%U %Udescription%U]
 
When you register a channel, you are recorded as the
"Founder" of the channel.  The channel founder is allowed to
change all of the channel settings for the channel; ChanServ
will also automatically give the founder channel-operator
privileges when s/he enters the channel.
 
NOTES:

Channel passwords are no longer used, however, the command
will still accept a password as a safety feature.  The password
you specify will be discarded.  If you want to add a description,
you must also specify a password.

In order to register a channel, you must have first registered
your nickname.  If you haven't, %B/msg NickServ HELP%B for
information on how to do so.
