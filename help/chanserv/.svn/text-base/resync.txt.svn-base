%BChanServ RESYNC%B Synchronizes users in the channel with the
userlist. This means that if the user can normally get ops,
ChanServ makes sure the user has ops. Otherwise, if the user
normally gets voice, ChanServ makes sure the user has voice but
not ops. Otherwise, ChanServ makes sure the user has neither
voice nor ops.

This is actually implemented via CS CLEAR <#chan> OPS, and a
CS UP #chan <all users>

Syntax: %BRESYNC%B %U#channel [#channel [#channel]]%U
