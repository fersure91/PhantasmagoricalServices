%BChanServ MLOCK%B allows you to lock channel modes either
on or off.

Syntax: %BMLOCK%B %U#channel%U %B<SET|ADD|DEL>%B %Umodes%U

The %Umodes%U parameter is constructed exactly the same way as
a %B/MODE%B command; that is, modes preceded by a %B+%B are locked
on, and modes preceded by a %B-%B are locked off.

%BWarning:%B  If you set a mode-locked key, as in the example
below, you should also restrict who can join the channel.
(see %B/cs HELP LEVELS SET%B) Otherwise, anyone entering the channel
when it is empty will be able to see the key!

Examples:

    %BMLOCK%B %U#channel%U %BADD%B %U+QS-M%U
       Adds +Q, +S and -M to your mlock.

    %BMLOCK%B %U#channel%U %BDEL%B %UQ%U
       Removes Q from your mlock, it may be +Q or -Q.

    %BMLOCK%B %U#channel%U %BSET%B %U+nt-iklps%U
       Forces modes n and t on, and modes i, k, l, p, and
       s off.  Mode m (and others) are left free to be either
       on or off.

    %BMLOCK%B %U#channel%U %BSET%B %U+knst-ilmp%U %Umy-key%U
       Forces modes k, n, s, and t on, and modes i, l, m,
       and p off.  Also forces the channel key to be
       "my-key".

    %BMLOCK%B %U#channel%U %BSET%B %U+%U
       Removes the mode lock; all channel modes are free
       to be either on or off.
