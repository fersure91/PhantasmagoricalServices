%BChanServ AKICK%B maintains the AutoKick list for a channel.
If a user on the AutoKick list attempts to join the channel,
ChanServ will ban that user from the channel, then kick the user.
 
Syntax: %BAKICK%B %U#channel%U %BADD%B %Unick/mask%U %Ureason%U
        %BAKICK%B %U#channel%U %BDEL%B %Unick/mask/list%U
        %BAKICK%B %U#channel%U %BLIST%B
 
The %BAKICK ADD%B command adds the given nick or hostmask to
the AutoKick list.
#If a %Ureason%U is given with the
#command, that reason will be used when the user is kicked;
#if not, the default reason is "You have been banned from the
#channel".

The %BAKICK DEL%B command removes the given nick, mask or
sequence of numbered-entries from the AutoKick list.  It does
not, however, remove any bans placed by an AutoKick; those must
be removed manually.

The %BAKICK LIST%B command displays the AutoKick list.
#or
#optionally only those AutoKick entries which match the given
#mask.
