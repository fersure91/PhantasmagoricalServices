%BChanServ SET OPGUARD%B makes ChanServ strictly
control channel status.

Syntax: %BSET%B %U#channel%U %BOPGUARD%B %UON/OFF%U
  
When OpGuard is set to ON, only people with the
appropriate permission will be allowed to grant
channel status to other users.

Note:  This setting will have no effect unless you
also change the %BLEVELS%B settings for VOICE, HOP,
OP, and/or PROTECT.  See %B/cs help levels%B
