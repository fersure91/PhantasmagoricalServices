%BChanServ SET FOUNDER%B changes the founder of a channel.
You must be the current founder of the channel, and the new
founder must have a registered nick.

Syntax: %BSET%B %U#channel%U %BFOUNDER%B %Unick%U

Once you have used this command, you will be automatically
moved to the channel's co-founder list; you may then remove
yourself or demote yourself to any lower rank.
