%BNickServ RECOVER%B allows you to get back your nick if
someone else is using it. It's slightly nicer than GHOST.

NickServ will change the target's nick to a guestnick, and
jupes the nick for one minute. To use it yourself, use 
%BNS RELEASE%B, then change your nick, OR use %BNS SIDENTIFY%B

Syntax: %BRECOVER%B %Unickname%U [%Upassword%U]

This command also identifies you to your nick if you are not
already. If you are already identified, the password is
optional.
