%BNickServ REGISTER%B allows you to reserve a particular nickname for
your own use and prove your identity using a password.

Syntax: %BREGISTER <password> <e-mail>%B

%BNOTICE:%B The email address is %BNOT%B optional and you are strongly
discouraged from using a fake address, as this will make it impossible
to prove your ownership of a nick should you forget your password.
