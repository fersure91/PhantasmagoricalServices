%BNickServ IDENTIFY%B tells NickServ that you are really
the owner of this nick.  Many commands require you to
authenticate yourself with this command before you use them.
The password should be the same one you sent with the
%BREGISTER%B command.

Syntax: %BIDENTIFY%B [%Unick%U] %Upassword%U

Examples:
    IDENTIFY n00b
    IDENTIFY Soulja soulseeker
    ID bob thebuilder

You MUST specifiy the nick if identifying to a nick you're
not using right now, or for nicks with %BHIGH%B or %BKILL%B
protection.
