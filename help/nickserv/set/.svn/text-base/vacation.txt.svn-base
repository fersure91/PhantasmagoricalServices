%BNickServ SET VACATION%B extends the time limit on nick
expiration from %E$services::conf{'nickexpire'}%E days to %E$services::conf{'vacationexpire'}%E days.  Your nick must
be at least %Eint($services::conf{'vacationexpire'}/3)%E days old for this to be available.

The flag is cleared on your next identify, and you will not be
able to use it again until %Eint($services::conf{'vacationexpire'}/3)%E days have passed.
