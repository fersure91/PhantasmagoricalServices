%BNickServ GHOST%B terminates a "ghost" IRC session using
your nick.  A "ghost" session is one which is not actually
connected, but which the IRC server believes is still online.
Typically, this happens when your Internet connection goes down
while you're on IRC.

Syntax: %BGHOST%B %Unickname%U [%Upassword%U]
#
#In order to use the GHOST command for a nick, your current
#address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick's access
#list, or you must supply the correct password for the
#nickname.
#
#This command also identifies you to your nick if you are not
#already.
