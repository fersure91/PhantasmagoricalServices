%BNickServ AUTH%B is used for reviewing and approving/rejecting
channel access grants.

ACCEPT  - Approve the authorization request and memo the person confirmation.
APPROVE - Same as accept.
DECLINE - Decline the authorization request and memo the person
          that you will not be added to that channel list.
REJECT  - Same as decline
LIST    - List auth requests.

Syntax: AUTH [nick] <LIST|ACCEPT|DECLINE> [num|chan]

If you do not want to be added to that channel list, use decline or reject.
Demotions are handled by deleting the target's access, so they may accept
the demotion, or no access at all.
