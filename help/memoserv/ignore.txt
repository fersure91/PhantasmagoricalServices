%BMemoServ IGNORE%B gives you the ability to manage a
permanent MemoServ ignore list with this command. All
nicknames added to your ignore list must be registered. If a
nickname on your ignore list tries to send you a memo, the
ignored person will be notified that they are on your ignore
list and you do not wish to receive any memos from them.

%BSyntax: IGNORE [ADD|DEL|LIST] [<nick>]%B

This is a good way to avoid memos from people who spam you.
They can get around an ignore by registering a different
nickname, but if people do so just to continue spamming, you
can report them to networks staff.

MemoServ abuse is uncommon since it requires that the person
register a nick to do it, and thus leaves a record of who
was causing problems.

Examples:
/msg memoserv ignore add benny
/msg memoserv ignore del Dainera
/msg memoserv ignore list
