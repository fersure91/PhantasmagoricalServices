%BSecurityBot TKL%B is a series of functions to make TKL
handling easier. Specifically it will help in handling
G:lines and GZ:lines.

Syntax is as follows:

TKL LIST [(+/- filters) [params]]
TKL DEL <(+/- filters) <params>>

Filters are case-sensitive.

Filter-parameters may be delimited by // (for regexps) or
"" (for regexps or strings).  Otherwise space delimiters are
assumed. if there is a mismatch in the filter vs param count,
the command WILL fail.

Filters may be any of:
  Globbing filters
    r    %BReason%B
    m    %BMask%B (ident@host only)
    s    %BSetter%B
  Regular Expression filters
    R    %BReason%B
    M    %BMask%B (ident@host only)
    S    %BSetter%B
  Miscellaneous Filters
    O/o  %BOrder by%B (Sort by) - case insensitive.
         negative is Descending, positive is Ascending.
         You can specify multiple of these, but the
         resulting sort order is not always intuitive.
         Default is type,time,host Ascending.
         Legal, but not necessarily meaningful for delete.
         Available sort fields: %Btype%B, %Bident%B, %Bhost%B, %Bsetter%B,
         %Bexpire%B, %Btime%B, %Breason%B.

Example:

TKL LIST -r+s *warez* *netadmin*
would list all bans that do not include the word 'warez'
and set by an oper with 'netadmin' in their vhost.
