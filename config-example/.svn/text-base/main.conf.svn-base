# This determines whether passwords in services (and possibly some other modules)

# a) if your network is under threat of hacking
# b) if your network is large
# c) to alleviate some fears from users.

# If you set this to 1, and run db-setup, all of the nickreg passes will be
# hashed for you. This process is irreversible, short of reverting to
# a backup copy of your database. Keeping the backup for any period of time
# violates the point of hashing your passwords.
