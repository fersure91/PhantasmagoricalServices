* Perl 5.8 and standard modules. (threads no longer required)
	NOTE: Many linux distros place Perl's standard modules in a separate
	package from Perl itself.
* MySQL 4.1 or 5.0. 5.1 and up are not supported.
* Event module from CPAN
* Date::Parse module from CPAN
Both the Event and Date::Parse modules should be available
in your favourite distro.
