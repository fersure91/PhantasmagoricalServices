	This is a utility for converting Anope databases to SrSv. For
this to work, you'll need a current copy of ircservices for their
convert-epona tool. This tool converts an epona/anope database to XML,
and the parsexml script loads that XML file into your database.

A) It does not handle channel access, as there is no reliable conversion
between anope's LEVELS system and SrSv's xOP system.

B) It currently does not handle memos, although it probably could.

C) As SrSv has no concept of forbidden nicks or channels (nicks are
usually handled by just registering, and holding, and channels can be
just closed) this is not handled either.

D) Channel passwords are simply discarded, as SrSv does not use channel
passwords.

E) This program has not been tested with a recent anope database,
although we believe it was done with an early 1.7.x version.

F) It is likely that the conversion can be done w/o the ircservices
tools by converting Anope's MySQL database directly, however it has not
been done yet.

G) This database converter is BETA SOFTWARE. It is not guaranteed to not
eat your data for lunch with a little barbecue sauce, and then burp
happily.

H) At present, merging two databases is NOT SUPPORTED, although it
should be entirely possible. It merely has not been tested. Further,
there is NO resolution method for collisions between the two databases
for either channels or nicks.
